# Inference Example Projects

This repository currently contains three inference example targets in [this directory](cpp).
- [A C++ representation of Dataspree Inferernce's core components](cpp/inference).
- Example code on the TCP Input and Output: [A Full example](cpp/examples/tcp_cli), [The final code from the TCP tutorial](cpp/examples/tcp_tutorial) that can be found [here](https://docs.data-spree.com/tutorials/tcp_connection), and [an empty playground repository](cpp/examples/tcp_tutorial_playground) to follow along with the implementation.
